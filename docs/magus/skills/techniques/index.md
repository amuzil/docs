# Techniques

A technique is a specific set of forms. This is the basic “move”. It consumes chi and has some kind of effect.

For example, think of [earth wall](earth/earth-wall.md) as a technique that creates a wall of earth in front of the caster,
or [earth spear](earth/earth-spear.md) as a technique that launches a spear of earth at a target.

Techniques can be unlocked and upgraded in the skill tree.
