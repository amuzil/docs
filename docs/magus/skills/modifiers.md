# Modifiers

A modifier is a simple piece of data that can be added by executing a form in a certain way.

## Common modifiers

Common modifiers can be unlocked by anyone in the skill tree.

### Focus

Charges the technique by holding down the form button.

### Multi

Multiplies the technique by repeating the form button.

### Directional

Aims the technique in a certain direction by walking that way.
Additionally, the `shift`/`sneak` key makes it "lower", such as for
a fire kick sweep, or block.

### Target

Aims the technique at a target by looking at them.

## Special modifiers

Special modifiers can be earned through various means, included out-of-game activities such as supporting the projects.
These special modifiers include VFX and flavour finishers.

## Example

An _earth wall_ has a [directional](#directional) modifier, which specifies in what direction the wall appears.
_Earth spear_ has a [target](#target) modifier, which means that you need to specify a target the spear should aim for.
