# Modifiers

A modifier is a simple piece of data that can be added by
executing a form in a certain way.

## Common modifiers

Common modifiers can be unlocked by anyone in the skill tree.

### Focus

Charges the technique by holding down the form button.

### Multi

Multiplies the technique by repeating the form button.

### Directional

Aims the technique in a certain direction by walking that way.
Additionally, there is a difference between "lower" and "upper",
such as with a _Fire Kick_ or a Block. By default, the direction
is "upper", but it can be changed by holding down the `Sneak` key.

### Target

Aims the technique at a target by looking at them.

## Special modifiers

Special modifiers can be earned through various means, included out-of-game
activities such as supporting the projects.
These special modifiers include VFX and flavour finishers.

## Example

An [earth wall](/magus/skills/techniques/earth-wall.md) has
a [directional](#directional) modifier,
which specifies in what direction the wall appears.
[Earth spear](/magus/skills/techniques/earth-spear.md) has
a [target](#target) modifier,
which means that you need to specify a target the spear should aim for.
