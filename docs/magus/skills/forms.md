# Forms

A form is a fundamental type of movement or interaction with the environment. They are mainly used as building blocks
for input. They are often applied to a specific target, which can be a chunk of bended element or in some cases a
creature, animal or plant.

## Base forms

### Push

Pushes the target.

### Pull

Pulls the target.

### Burst

Violently shoots out the target, like a shotgun. The release of compressed force. More powerful than blast, but less controlled.

### Arc

Swirls the target around you. Useful for charging lightning or whips, or generating a protective field around you. A selected target is not required for this form, as shown by it being usable for lightning.

### Shrink

Compresses the target, for example into a sphere.

### Grow

Increases the size of the target. Although sometimes it might have the same effect as the focus modifier, they are not the same and can have varying effects.

### Twist

Twists the target. For example, it rotates a projectile.

### Strike

Strikes the target. Think air gust or fire blast. Can be modified for ranged, or left as is for melee.

### Block

Blocks from an attack by the target.

### Raise

Lifts the target.

### Lower

Lowers the target.

## Element specific forms

Elements can have forms unique to them.
