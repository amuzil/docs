# Forms

A form is a fundamental type of movement or interaction with the environment.
They are mainly used as building blocks for input.
They are often applied to a specific target,
which can be a chunk of bendable element
or in some cases a creature, animal or plant.

While forms do not directly have an effect, basic Skills called Effects could made up by a single form.
With a combination of Effects and Forms, you could compose
complex techniques.
