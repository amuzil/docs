# Forms

A form is a fundamental type of movement or interaction with the environment.
They are mainly used as building blocks for input.
They are often applied to a specific target,
which can be a chunk of bendable element
or in some cases a creature, animal or plant.

## Base forms

Pushes the target.

#### Usage
VR: Push one or both arms away from the player.

### Lower

### Burst

Violently shoots out the target, like a shotgun. The release of compressed force. More powerful than blast, but less controlled.

#### Usage
VR: Thrust both arms out violently together, like a kamehameha.

Multikey: Left and right click simultaneously.

### Arc

Swirls the target around you. Useful for charging lightning or whips, or generating a protective field around you. A selected target is not required for this form, as shown by it being usable for lightning.

#### Usage
VR: A general circular motion with both arms, like taichi.

Multikey: Mouse motion in a circle, `Sneak`.

### Shrink

Compresses the target; E.g. into a sphere.

#### Usage
VR: Hands slowly close in together, as if compressing something.

Multikey: `Sneak`, mouse wheel towards the player.

### Grow

Increases the size of the target. Although sometimes it might have the same effect as the focus modifier, they are not the same and can have varying effects.

#### Usage
VR: Hands start together and slowly come apart, as if you’re tearing something.

Multikey: `Sneak`, mouse wheel away from the player.

### Twist

Twists the target. For example, it rotates a projectile.

#### Usage
VR: Twist either or both of the player’s arms clockwise or anti-clockwise. 
Spin direction depends on what the technique requires; otherwise just flavour, 
intensity matters more.

Multikey: A>W>D>S twice; goes through directional inputs clockwise twice. 
Also works anti-clockwise.

### Strike

Strikes the target. Think air gust or fire blast. Can be modified for ranged, or left as is for melee.

#### Usage
VR: Forceful motion with one arm in a direction.

Multikey: Left click.

### Block

Blocks from an attack by the target.

#### Usage
VR: Hold down the block button and move the controller to meet a projectile. 
Other effects can be gotten by crossing your arms over your chest.

Multikey: Right click.

Note: This will be used in a Sekiro/Elden Ring-esque timed parry system.

### Breathe

Focuses energy within the user's chest. Useful for buff abilities, or techniques
such as Ice Breath.

#### Usage
VR: Arms together at sternum, then by sides in a martial arts pose (will find a picture later). 
Head down, then up, at the same time as the arm motion. Essentially exhale then inhale.

Multikey: Double tap `Sneak`, hold on the 2nd press.

### Step
Mobility in a direction parallel with the ground. 
Can be combined with other forms and modifiers to work in any direction.

#### Usage
VR: Flick the VR motion controller joystick twice, or flick both wrists twice simultaneously in a direction.
