# Forms

A form is a fundamental type of movement or interaction with the environment.
They are mainly used as building blocks for input.
They are often applied to a specific target,
which can be a chunk of bendable element
or in some cases a creature, animal or plant.

## Base forms

Useful for charging lightning or whips,
or generating a protective field around you.
A selected target is not required for this form,
as shown by it being usable for lightning.

### Block

Blocks from an attack by the target.

### Breathe

Focuses energy within the user's chest.
Useful for buff abilities or techniques such as _ice breath_.

### Burst
